If you want a line in the middle of the page, put a frame on the second step. But it'll create a box.
^Zine is letter-size. It won't print quite right on letter paper otherwise. 

~~Consider removing \printendnotes from the template and instructing the user to sprinkle it throughout as they please?~~

~~Use \originalHref to insert links without endnotes.~~

    Update: No more endnotes, they're not worth it. Direct users to use footnotes like so:
        `This is a link stuck somewhere in the text.^[<https://google.com>]`

I had to zoom/adjust to get a good quarter-fold. A4 is much better.

The hardest thing to set into the document was easily 'W3bK3rN3l radio outpost' due to the difficulty of escaping lots of characters

Mention a couple optional things, like a lack of page numbers. You can just turn them back on.
Also mention formatting you get for free, like code boxes having syntax highlighting.
