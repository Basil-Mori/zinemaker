**About ^Z**

Ctrl-ZINE (^Z) is a Ctrl-c.club/Smol Web collaborative zine that celebrates
tech and the Smol Web. Started in March 2023, it runs a monthly issue, where
anyone can download a PDF version and a pre-folded PDF version for home
printing. No digital format of the content is maintained on a Website
whatsoever. Some of the topics within these issues range from Smol Web
protocols and communities (ActivityPub, Tildeverse), Web-adjacent protocols
(Gopher, Gemini), alternative forms of communication (HAM radio, IRC),
snippets of code, artwork, and anything tech-related that is an expression of
self.

Those who contribute to ^Z are passionate about what they share. They want
what is best for Us, the citizens of the Web. With that, anyone with that same
passion is welcome and encouraged to contribute to future issues. Further info
can be found in the Editorial section of this issue. May the Smol Web live
forever!
